# Flash storage

Putting data directly into storage is the easiest to make information accessible to smart contracts. However, the convenience comes at a high price, as the storage access is the most costly operation in [EVM](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) (20k gas for 256bit word ~ $160k for 1Mb checked 30/08/2021) making it prohibitively expensive to use.

Flash storage implements an alternative design of providing data to smart contracts. Instead of constantly persisting data on EVM storage, the information is brought on-chain only when needed (**on-demand fetching**). Until that moment, the data remains available in the [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) blockchain where data providers are incentivised to keep information accurate and up to date. Data is transferred to EVM via a mechanism based on a [meta-transaction pattern](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/ethereum-meta-transactions-90ccf0859e84) and the information integrity is verified on-chain through signature checking.
